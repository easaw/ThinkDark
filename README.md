### Instructions:

After installing [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) on Google Chrome, click the Stylebot logo on your Chrome toolbar (a white S on a dark grey background), and click Options and on the Stylebot Options page, click the blue button that says "Add a new style..."

Where it says "Enter URL...", copy and paste `x.thunkable.com/projects/*` (do not add https:// but you must include the asterisk). Then add this link to the styles in the space below `@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easaw/ThinkDark/master/ThinkDark.css");`
See images below for how to add the details to Stylebot.

Please ensure you use parallel inverted commas e.g. "like this" when copying and pasting the link, they should not be 66/99 style “like this”. It does make a difference.
